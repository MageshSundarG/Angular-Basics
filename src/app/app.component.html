<!-- ngModel is a so-called directive and what it does is it basically tells Angular to listen to anything
you enter and store it in this name property, in this name model, 
but also on the other hand, output the value of the name model in this input.-->

<input type="text" [(ngModel)]='name'>

<p>{{name}}</p>
